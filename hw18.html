            User Research
        <p class="paragraph">I conducted a minimum of 5 Interviews and created online surveys. I had to come up with research plans and a series of questions so that I could interview my users. From doing this I was able to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Use that data to find the issue and create a design that would connect and solve my users' problems.</p>

            Web Development
        <p class="paragraph">Before conducting interviews, I had to find participate in person or over zoom. Give a brief summary of what the questions will be on and if I had their permission to record. I would ask open-end questions and the interviews would only last 30 mins or less. Depending on how fast the participant answers each question. 
            During the interviews, I was able to find the common problem and come up with a user insight statement and continue through the process of I like, I wish, what if methods.
